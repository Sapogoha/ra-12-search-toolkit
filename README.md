# Search

## Redux Observable

This is simple search module.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project I use [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [Redux Observable](https://redux-observable.js.org)

### In order to check the project, you can run

#### `npm start`

on both `frontend` and `backend` directories.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
